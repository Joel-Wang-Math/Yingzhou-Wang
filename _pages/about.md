Hi! I'm **Yingzhou Wang**, a master's student in the Department of Mathematics at **UW–Madison**.  
I work on **optimization**, **computational mathematics**, and numerical methods for inverse problems.

My current research involves applying **multigrid methods** and **optimization algorithms** to large-scale phase retrieval problems. Previously, I studied **LASSO**, and related iterative algorithms.

I am broadly interested in:
- Numerical optimization  
- PDE-based computational methods  
- Inverse problems  
- Algorithms that connect mathematical theory and real-world decision making  

Outside research, I enjoy running, swimming and exploring Madison’s lakes.
