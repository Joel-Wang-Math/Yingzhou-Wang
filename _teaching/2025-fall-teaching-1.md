I am a Teaching Assistant for **Math 320: Linear Algebra and Differential Equations** at UW–Madison, where I lead three weekly discussion sections (around 60 students in total).

### Responsibilities
- Designing guided examples, and weekly exit tickets  
- Leading problem-solving sessions and facilitating group discussions  
- Holding office hours at the Math Learning Center (MLC)  
- Supporting students with matrix algebra, eigenvalues, ODE systems, and numerical methods  

### Teaching Philosophy
I aim to make mathematical ideas intuitive and approachable.  
My discussion sections focus on:
- clear step-by-step reasoning  
- collaborative learning in small groups  


### Notes
Teaching Math 320 has strengthened my ability to explain abstract concepts clearly and to support students with diverse mathematical backgrounds. I enjoy helping students develop confidence in linear algebra and differential equations through structured reasoning and active engagement.
